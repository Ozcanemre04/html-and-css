            <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that
                gaz
                opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
                such
                thing as an issue.</p>

            <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing
                exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
                changes.
                That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
                translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on
                that way.
                Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>

            <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out
                of that
                grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
                person is
                the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
                world,
                it’s that you passively do it anyway.

        <div class="zero">
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around
                to commiserate. They said,<q class="other">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                    unfortunate.</q> The
                farmer said,<q class="farmer">Is it<em class="good">good</em>? Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't
                    know.</q> The next
                day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
                with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="other">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a
                    great turn of events.
                    You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer">Is it <em class="good">good
                    </em>?Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know.</q></p>

            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his leg.
                The neighbors then said,<q class="other">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the
                farmer
                responded,<q class="farmer">Is it
                    <em class="good">good</em>? Is it bad? I don't
                    know.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and
                they rejected
                his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="other">Isn’t
                    that great!</q> Again, he
                said,<q class="farmer">Is it <em class="good"> good</em>? Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't
                    know.</q>

        <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because
            you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</q>

            <em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em
